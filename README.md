# Secure Offline Notes App

A simple offline note web app using **ESP32** and an **SD card module**.  

I used an **ESP32-C3 MINI**, but you can use any ESP32 as long as you use the correct connections.  
All your notes will be saved on the SD card in a text file named `Notes.txt`, so you can access them later on a dedicated offline computer.  

If you like this project, please give it a star so more people can find it, and feel free to check out my other projects.  

If you find any bugs or glitches, please let me know. Even better: if you fix it, explain how you did it so I can update the code and make everything work correctly.

## How to Set Up
Important: Be careful to connect everything correctly so you donâ€™t accidentally break anything.  
If the parts get very hot or you smell burning, unplug the device immediately and check your wiring.
